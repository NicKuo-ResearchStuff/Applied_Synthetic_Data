## Overview

From the 13–14 February 2025, the 6th National University of South Carolina Big Data Health Science Student Case Competition brought together students from across the United States for two days of intensive modelling, collaboration, and innovation.

The event is part of the [annual USC Big Data Health Science Conference](https://bigdata.sc.edu/2025-annual-conference/)
which convenes universities, industry, and healthcare stakeholders to advance data-driven solutions for public health.

This year, the competition centred around a crucial question:</br>
*How can synthetic Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) for HIV data be used to understand treatment pathways, improve prediction, and support clinical decision-making?*

Teams from diverse backgrounds explored this challenge using [the Health Gym Synthetic ART for HIV dataset](https://github.com/NicKuo-ResearchStuff/Health_Gym_AI/tree/main/Blogs/Blogs001_Intro), developed to support education, research, and collaborative innovation.

## **The Dataset**

Teams worked with the Synthetic ART for HIV dataset, a [GAN-based synthetic dataset](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046423001570), including:

| Data Type                | Example Fields                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Patient Demographics** | `patient_id`, `age`, `sex`, `ethnicity`     |
| **Clinical Markers**     | `viral_load`, `CD4_count`, `follow_up_time` |
| **Drug Regimens**        | `FTC+TDF`, `3TC+ABC`, `DRV+FTC+TDF`, `DTG`  |
| **Treatment Dynamics**   | regimen switches, suppression milestones    |


The use of synthetic HIV data allowed:</br>
- Students from different states could collaborate without waiting for regulatory clearance or data-sharing agreements.
- Viral load trajectories, CD4 recovery, regimen sequences, and treatment milestones were preserved statistically — enabling genuine clinical reasoning.
- Teams built neural networks, risk scores, and survival pipelines in under 48 hours.
- Synthetic data became the common language that allowed public health, computer science, business analytics, and biostatistics students to work together on the same clinically meaningful task.

Together, the participating universities demonstrated how synthetic datasets can serve as a catalyst for nationwide collaboration in health data science education.

Student reflections highlighted their key learnings:
* handling messy, real-world-like clinical data
* connecting ML outputs to public health impact
* communicating complex ideas clearly
* developing collaborative workflows in short time frames

## Why It Matters

This competition reflects that:</br>
*Synthetic data can serve as the foundation for scalable, safe, inclusive health data science education.*

By enabling open, realistic, privacy-preserving learning environments, synthetic datasets help universities:
* expand participation
* reduce administrative barriers
* teach real-world clinical analytics
* prepare students for careers at the intersection of ML and public health
